# MathGraph

MathGraph is a lightweight generative verification kernel for AI-assisted
mathematics. Models propose. MathGraph constrains. Verifiers decide. Digestion
assimilates. The Lawbook remembers. Projection scales.

Only verifier, trusted importer, finite validator, and chain audit boundaries
promote truth. Everything else may guide search, explanation, scheduling, or
memory without becoming a theorem.

## Trust Boundary

Every accepted claim ends in exactly one terminal form:

| Terminal form | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `VERIFIED_PROOF` | A proof accepted by an explicit verifier/importer/audit boundary |
| `FINITE_COUNTERMODEL` | A checked finite witness that separates source from target |
| `NAMED_OBSTRUCTION` | A structured accepted obstruction record |

| Advisory artifact | What it may do | What it may not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| route score, H-Tilt, discovery value | rank work | prove a claim |
| digestion, exposition, analogy | explain or compress | verify |
| curricula, repair plans, process memory | plan or replay work | create truth |
| structural identity, typed projection, roles, habits, reasons | organize memory and route pressure | create certificates or accepted theorems |

## Current Architecture

```text
Domain Claim
  -> Continuation Actions
  -> Continuation Curriculum
  -> Verification Episode
  -> Verifier / Importer / Finite Validator / Chain Audit
  -> Proof Digestion
  -> Verifier Feedback / Repair
  -> Discovery Value
  -> Lawbook Acceptance
  -> Lawbook Query / Known Skip
  -> Structural Identity
  -> Habit Rules
  -> Reason Compression
  -> Process Memory
  -> Structure Registry / Typed Projection
  -> Role-Based Object Introduction
  -> Structural Analogy / Exposition
  -> Projection
  -> Telemetry
```

## Implemented Modules

- domain claims, Lean adapter hardening, verification episodes, projection, and telemetry
- continuation actions and curricula
- proof digestion, verifier feedback, and repair
- discovery value, Lawbook acceptance, Lawbook query, and known skip
- structural identity, habit rules, and reason compression
- process memory, structure registry, typed projection, role objects, and structural analogy/exposition

The first practical proving ground is SAIR Stage 2, equational implication over
magmas. It is a nursery world, not the whole product.

## CLI And Tooling

Repo scripts expose the implemented layers as small backend-first tools:

- `scripts/run_roadmap_alignment.py`
- `scripts/run_reason_compression.py`
- `scripts/run_process_memory.py`
- `scripts/run_structure_registry.py`
- `scripts/run_role_objects.py`
- `scripts/run_structural_analogy.py`

These tools emit advisory artifacts unless an already-existing verifier boundary
is being reported. They do not bypass the terminal contract.

## Current Status

Implemented milestones run through M6.19 Structural Analogy and Exposition.
M6.20 synchronizes the public documentation and publication spec with that
implemented architecture. See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the live
roadmap and [docs/agentic_alchemical_loop.md](docs/agentic_alchemical_loop.md)
for the process view. See also [docs/manifesto.md](docs/manifesto.md) and
[docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md).

## Future Work

- richer formal-world adapters
- deeper proof-system integration
- semantic and natural-language claim handling with strict boundaries
- API service hardening
- existential agents

MathGraph should not scale by becoming bigger. It should scale by making every
verified thing reusable and every failure informative.
